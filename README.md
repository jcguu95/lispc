# TODO

1. Build Tests

   + Check if old version works with `myls.cl`.
   + Write asd file with automatic tests.
   + Build github CI/CD.
   + Add more tests (e.g. by translating C codes I have, learning how c/macro works).

2. Mold the Language

   + Resolve as many unnecessary macros as possible.
   + Tweak parts I dislike.
