# TODO

1. Build Tests

   + [X] Use the old version to generate c code, and use that as the standard test.
   + Write asd file with automatic tests.
   + Build github CI/CD.
   + Add more tests (e.g. by translating C codes I have, learning how c/macro works).

2. Mold the Language

   + Resolve as many unnecessary macros as possible.
   + Tweak parts I dislike.
