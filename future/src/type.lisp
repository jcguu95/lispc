;; TODO Redo for the type system: Basic types are represented as keywords,
;; while composed types are represented as lists whose cars are of the
;; following: :pt, :fn, :struct, :array. The users can write
;; instead :pt, :fn, :{}, :[] respectively, but a normalizer will transform it
;; into the canonical, longer forms. Write util functions to handle and
;; inspect types. Allow users to define more type operators (e.g. :pt :fn as
;; above). Finally, write a printer, and integrate that with SET and DECLARE.
;; Mention that the type system is by no means complete, yet the user can
;; inline any C codes so that's not a problem.

;; TODO Change syntax from (:array () :int) to (:array :int)
