;; TODO Redo for the type system: Basic types are represented as keywords,
;; while composed types are represented as lists whose cars are of the
;; following: :pointer, :function, :struct, :array.

;; TODO The users can write instead :pointer, :function, :(), :{}, :[]
;; respectively, but a normalizer will transform it into the canonical, longer
;; forms. Write util functions to handle and inspect types. Allow users to
;; define more type operators (e.g. :pointer :function as above).

;; TODO Finally, write a printer, and integrate that with SET and DECLARE.
;; Mention that the type system is by no means complete, yet the user can
;; inline any C codes so that's not a problem.

;; TODO Change syntax from (:array () :int) to (:array :int)

;; TODO Support `volatile pointer`. (an example from https://cdecl.org/):
;; declare bar as volatile pointer to array 64 of const int
;;
;; const int (* volatile bar)[64]

;; TODO Support `cast`. An example from https://cdecl.org/: cast foo into
;; block(int, long long) returning double
;;
;; (double (^)(int , long long ))foo
