* TODOs
** Basic Functionalities
*** New Type System
**** DONE Type Spec
**** NEXT Type Formatter
*** Preprocessor Directives

e.g. #ifndef..
*** Block and GOTO

*** Lisp Interopts

*** Design: Perhaps don't invert readtable?

If we do not invert case in readtable, we must then use =:perserve= mode, and
the users must use explicit uppercase for lisp interopt.

** Provide Many Examples as Programmatic Tests
*** Transpile examples from Learn C the Hard Way
