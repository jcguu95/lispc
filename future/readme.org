#+end_src

* TODOs
** Basic Functionalities
*** New Type System
**** DONE Type Spec
**** DONE Type Formatter
**** DONE Hook into main code / main test

*** Preprocessor Directives

e.g. #ifndef..

*** Block and GOTO

*** Lisp Interopts

*** Design: Perhaps don't invert readtable?

If we do not invert case in readtable, we must then use =:perserve= mode, and
the users must use explicit uppercase for lisp interopt.

** Provide Many Examples as Programmatic Tests
*** Transpile examples from Learn C the Hard Way

** Run automatic tests in =./examples/=

Under the =./examples/= directory, process all =*.lsp= files, compile them with
=paren=, and compare the results with the corresponding =*.c= files.

** TODO compile-lsp-file

Add a function that directly executes a *.lsp file by compiling into C,
executing, and printing its output to repl.
